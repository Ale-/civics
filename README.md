# Civics

This is the repository of the _civics_ platform, a project by [Vivero de Iniciativas Ciudadanas](http://viveroiniciativasciudadanas.net/). The aim of the platform is to draw an emergent map of the citizen practices that make the city a more inclusive, sustainable, participatory and livable place. The platform is developed by [wwb](wwb.cc) and it's written mainly in Django and Angular.
